# ContextualizedGAM
Contextualized Generalized Additive Models.

These were studied in [Automated interpretable discovery of heterogeneous treatment effectiveness: A COVID-19 case study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046422001022) to estimate personalized treatment benefits in healthcare data.

# Update
A more updated version of the ContextualGAMs are now included in the `Contextualized.ML` [package](https://github.com/cnellington/Contextualized) in the `contextualized.easy` directory.
